			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				Hello! My name is <span>Khunhour</span> and I enjoy long walks
				on the beach and JavaScript. Born in Cambodia, lost in Japan. I
				am a self-taught web developer on a path to become a Full Stack
				software engineer. I've always like building things and when I
				started touching on HTML and CSS, I knew that <span>this</span>{" "}
				is what I want to do in my career.
