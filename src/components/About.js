			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				Hello! My name is <span>Khunhour</span> and I enjoy long walks
				on the beach and JavaScript. I am a self-taught web developer 
				on a path to become a Full Stack software engineer. Ever since 
				I could remember, I've always like building things and when I
				started touching on HTML and CSS, I knew that <span>this</span>{" "}
				is what I want to do in my career.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since then, I've been learning more about Front-End technologies like 
				<span>React</span> and use it to build exciting projects as well as 
				contribute to open-source projects.
