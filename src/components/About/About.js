			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				Hello! My name is <span>Khunhour</span> and I am a self-taught{" "}
				<span>JavaScript</span> developer based in Japan. Ever since I
				could remember, I've always like building things and when I
				started touching on HTML and CSS, I knew that <span>this</span>{" "}
				is what I want to do in my career.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since then, I've been learning more about Front-End technologies
				like <span>React</span> and use it to build exciting projects as
				well as contribute as much as I can to open-source projects.
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently, I'm planning to learn about the <span>Back-End</span>{" "}
				side of web development, particularly with technologies like{" "}
				<span>Firebase</span> and <span>Node.js</span>.
