		description: <p>A fully responsive weather application that enables users to search weather 
			information via city's name. Leveraging data from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeatherMap API</a>, the app displays 
			the current weather forecast, hourly forecast for the next 24-hours as well as daily forecast
			 for the next 7 days. It also includes a toggle to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.</p>,
		challenges: <p>During this project, one notable challenge that I faced was dealing with time zone conversion. It did cause a little
			 bit headache, but I learned a lot about how <span>UTC</span> and <span>time zone</span> works. </p>,
